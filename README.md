# Polygence Coding Challenge

Welcome to the coding challenge portion of the Thinkful Engineering interview! Thank you for taking the time to go through this exercise and show us what you can contribute to the team.

## Project overview

We want to create an RESTful API to track our spendings.

A spending has the followings properties: 
- when it happened
- how much did we spend
- in what currency
- for what/description

This simple web API allows the clients to:

- Create a new spending
- List all the spendings
- List all the spendings ordered by amount, date
- List all the spendings filtered by currency

### Technical requirements

- Use Git and share the project on GitHub
- Use any SQL database to store data
- Write tests and as clean code as possible

### Not required, but nice to have

- Use a web framework (eg. Django)
- A React client application that can use the API. eg:
