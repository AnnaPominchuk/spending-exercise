# Polygence Coding Challenge

Welcome to the coding challenge portion of the Thinkful Engineering interview! Thank you for taking the time to go through this exercise and show us what you can contribute to the team.

## Project overview

![](app.png)

We want you to create a simple application to track spendings.

A spending has the followings properties: 
- when it happened
- how much did we spend
- in what currency
- for what/description

This simple web API allows the client applications to:

- Create a new spending
- List all the spendings
- List all the spendings ordered by amount, date
- List all the spendings filtered by currency

### Technical requirements

- Use Git and share the project on GitHub
- The backend solution can be written in any programming language
  - We have created a scaffolded Python/Flask and a Node.js/Express version
  - But you can start from scratch in any language
- Use any SQL database to store data
- Write tests and as clean code as possible

### What We Look For

This is an opportunity for you to show us what your best code looks like. While we expect the code to work, we are also looking for:

- Clean, modular code
- Clear naming and conventions
- Unit tests
- Error handling

### Not required, but nice to have

- Use a web framework (eg. Django)
- A React client application that can use the API. eg:
